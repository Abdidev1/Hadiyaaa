                To Hadiya, honestly, it’s crazy how in just 2 weeks you’ve become such an 
                essential part of my life. Some people stay for years and never truly "get" you, like anaya who lived 10 years
                but with you, it just clicked. You're the best replacement I could have ever 
                asked for, and I'm so glad you're here now. Thanks for being the amazing 
                person you are here's to many more days of us being chaotic! 🌸
